# Project: Recipes

From The Odin Project.

## Description

A set of 3 recipes from [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) with vaguely listed ingredients and the steps to reproduce the dish.

## Showcased skills

Basic HTML knowledge, including but not limited to link and image insertions, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists, etc.

Also, CSS styling has been implemented to the site, adding both colors and some typographical tweaks to the overall site. More carefully built elements like borders, margin and a better box structure have also been applied to the homepage.
